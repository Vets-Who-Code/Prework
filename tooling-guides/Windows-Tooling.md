Windows has significantly improved for web development, and with the right setup, you can create a powerful and efficient development environment.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

WSL allows you to run a Linux distribution within Windows, providing access to the same tools and terminal environment as Mac and Linux users. Follow these steps to set up WSL:

1. **Install WSL:** Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
   ```bash
   wsl --install
   ```
   For more detailed instructions, visit the [WSL installation guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

2. **Choose a Linux Distribution:** Once WSL is installed, choose a Linux distribution to install (Ubuntu is recommended for beginners).

3. **Initialize Your Distribution:** Open your newly installed Linux distribution from the Start menu and complete the initial setup.

4. **Update and Upgrade:** Run the following commands to update and upgrade your distribution:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```

### Install Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a powerful, open-source code editor available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Install it using the following command:

```bash
winget install --id Microsoft.VisualStudioCode
```

Or download it directly from the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

### Configure VSCode for WSL

1. **Open VSCode:** Launch Visual Studio Code.
2. **Open Terminal:** Press `Ctrl + ` to open the terminal.
3. **Open Command Palette:** Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` to open the command palette.
4. **Select Default Shell:** Type `Select Default Shell` and choose `WSL Bash` from the options.
5. **Open New Terminal:** Click on the `+` icon in the terminal window to open a new WSL Bash terminal.

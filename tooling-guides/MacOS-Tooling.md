## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Install Homebrew

Homebrew is a package manager that simplifies the installation and management of applications on macOS. To get started, open Terminal.app and run the following command:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### Install iTerm2

iTerm2 is a powerful alternative to the default Terminal.app, providing better features and customization options. Install iTerm2 using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install --cask iterm2
```

Now you can open iTerm2 from your Applications folder.

### Install Visual Studio Code

Next, let's install the best code editor in the galaxy: Visual Studio Code! Use the following command to install it via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install --cask visual-studio-code
```

In case you encounter any issues, you can alternatively use:

```bash
brew install visual-studio-code
```

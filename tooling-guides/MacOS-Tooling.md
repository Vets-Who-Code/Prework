# MacOS Tooling

[Install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

Homebrew is a [package manager](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/javascript-package-managers-101-9afd926add0a) that's going to make it simple to install and manage applications.

Run the following line in Terminal.app and then never use Terminal again. *(__Note:__ this is recommended, but not required, VSCode comes with a terminal built-in, you can skip to installing that if you get stuck)*

`brew cask install iterm2`

Now you can open iTerm2.app.

Next, let's install the best code editor in the galaxy! Visual Studio Code! üëèüèª

`brew install visual-studio-code`

possible üêû : You may need to enter `brew cask install visual-studio-code`

Now I'm sure you want to make your code editor more comfy, so checkout these two podcast episodes [here](https://syntax.fm/show/012/why-is-everyone-switching-to-vs-code) and [here](https://syntax.fm/show/048/vs-code-round-two) for the best tips and extensions out there. The podcast is great, but you can just read the show notes.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Push yourself to use shortcuts to improve productivity. [Here](https://medium.com/productivity-freak/macos-keyboard-shortcuts-41c8184f65a6) are some good shortcuts, but you'll also want to install CheatSheet.App so that you can see all the shortcuts every app you use has to offer.

`brew cask install cheatsheet`

Then hold down ‚åò for a bit, boom! shortcuts.

Good luck Mac users!

<h1 align="center">Module Consolidation Summary</h1>

**Date:** December 2024
**Purpose:** Streamline prework curriculum by combining overlapping modules

---

## Overview

The prework previously contained two sets of modules covering the same topics:
- **Comprehensive modules** (numbered 01-06): Detailed, in-depth content
- **Basic modules** (named): Shorter, introductory content

This consolidation combines both sets into **unified, comprehensive modules** that include VetsWhoCode branding and all essential content.

---

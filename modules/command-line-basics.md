<h1 align="center">Command Line Basics</h1>

In this module, we'll dive into the fundamentals of the command line, a powerful tool that will empower you to work your coding wizardry.

&emsp;

## ðŸ’» What's the Command Line?

The command line, often referred to as the "command prompt," "terminal," or "CLI" (Command Line Interface), is your backstage pass to interacting with your computer in a way that goes beyond clicking and dragging. It's where the real magic happens.

### Operating Systems and Access

- **MacOS:** To access the Terminal, navigate to `Applications` > `Utilities` > `Terminal`.
- **Windows:** Click `Start`, then `All Programs` > `Accessories` > `Command Prompt`.

&emsp;

## ðŸ“œ Command Line Operations

Let's start with some essential commands to navigate this new territory:

### Print Working Directory (Where Are You?)

- **MacOS:** Type `pwd` and press Enter.
- **Windows:** Use `cd` and press Enter.

### List Directories and Files

- **MacOS:** Type `ls` and press Enter.
- **Windows:** Use `dir` and press Enter.

### Creating a New Directory

- Create a new directory called "VetsWhoCode" by typing:
  ```bash
  mkdir VetsWhoCode
  ```
  and pressing Enter.

### Changing Your Working Directory

- Move into your new directory with:
  ```bash
  cd VetsWhoCode
  ```
  and press Enter.

### Going Back to the Previous Directory

- To return to the previous directory, simply type:
  ```bash
  cd ..
  ```
  and press Enter.

### Deleting a Directory (Oops!)

- **MacOS:** 
  ```bash
  rm -r NameOfDirectory
  ```
- **Windows:** 
  ```bash
  rmdir /S NameOfDirectory
  ```

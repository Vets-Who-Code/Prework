<h1 align="center">Capstone: Unleash Your Web Development Skills</h1>

Welcome, to the culmination of your prework journey! It's time to put your newfound skills to the test with a capstone project that allows you to shine and show us what you're made of. 

&emsp;
## :dart: The Challenge

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create a captivating website that introduces yourself to the us. Using the dynamic trio of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, craft an impressive creation that reflects your personality and aspirations.

### Why It Matters

This project isn't just a checkmark on your journey; it's your chance to dive deep into essential web development technologies. It's your opportunity to apply the concepts you've absorbed during this prework and showcase your creative prowess.

### What We're Looking For

We're not just interested in code; we want to see your creativity and ingenuity shine through your project. Craft a website that not only functions flawlessly but also tells us who you are. Your capstone will become the centerpiece of your application and a topic of discussion during your upcoming interview.


&emsp;
## :outbox_tray: Delivery Options

To share your creation with us, you have two options:

#### 1. Web Deployment

You can upload your code to one of the following platforms, which will provide a shareable URL for your project:

- [repl.it](https://replit.com/)
- [codepen](https://codepen.io/)
- [GitHub codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)

#### 2. Code Repository

Alternatively, you may choose to use a code repository. In this case, ensure that your README.md document offers clear instructions on running your code and consider including screenshots to illustrate your project's functionality and design.

**Pre-Work for Vets Who Code**

---

> *"This pre-work is how we set you up for success. Take your time, do it right, and you'll be ready for anything."*

---

**⏱ 40-60 Hours | 📅 Self-Paced | ✅ Required**

---

## Welcome

We're glad you're here. Choosing to pursue software engineering is a significant decision, and we're honored you've chosen Vets Who Code for this journey.

Let's talk about what's ahead.

The Hashflag Stack is an intensive 17-week program designed to take you from foundations to production AI engineer. The pace is challenging, the expectations are high, and the results speak for themselves—graduates are securing roles in the $85-130K range.

To make the most of the program, you'll need a solid foundation before Day 1. That's what this pre-work provides.

### What This Pre-Work Provides

- **40-60 hours** of foundational skills you'll complete before Day 1
- **Self-paced learning** — you set the schedule that works for your life
- **A realistic preview** of the program's pace and expectations
- **The foundation** that everything in the main curriculum builds upon

### Important Expectations

- This pre-work is **required** for program entry
- It requires **real effort** and dedication
- The skills here are **essential** — they can't be skipped and learned later
- This is **preparation designed to help you succeed**, not to discourage you

### Our Commitment to You

Complete this pre-work, and you'll arrive on Day 1 ready to dive into the curriculum. We won't spend valuable program time on setup and basics—we'll be building from the start.

If you find the pre-work challenging, that's valuable information. It may mean you need additional preparation time, and there's no shame in that. Many successful developers took longer paths to get where they are. We'd rather you take the time you need than struggle through the program unprepared.

If you complete this pre-work successfully, you've already demonstrated something important: you can learn independently, you can push through challenges, and you have what it takes to succeed in this program.

**Let's get started.**

## A Note About AI Tools

> ⚠️ **You will be interviewed on everything you build. Being able to explain your work is essential.**

AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Copilot are powerful resources. We want to be clear about how to use them effectively during your pre-work.

### AI is for Learning, Not Building

You're welcome to use AI to understand concepts, get explanations of how functions work, debug confusing error messages, or clarify documentation. These are legitimate learning activities.

However, we ask that you don't use AI to write your code for you.

Here's why this matters: The interview process includes a technical review of your pre-work. You'll walk through your code with our team, explain your decisions, and potentially make modifications on the spot. This conversation helps us understand your readiness for the program.

If you haven't written the code yourself, this will become apparent during the interview. More importantly, you'll miss the learning that comes from working through challenges on your own.

### Examples

| ✅ Great use of AI | ❌ Not recommended |
|---|---|
| "Can you explain what the forEach method does?" | "Write me a function that filters an array" |
| "Why might my event listener not be firing?" | "Build me a dark mode toggle for my website" |
| "What's the difference between let and const?" | "Create a responsive navigation menu for me" |

The goal of the pre-work is to build your skills. When you write the code yourself—making mistakes, getting stuck, figuring it out—that's when the real learning happens.

We're not trying to make things harder than they need to be. We're trying to ensure you have the foundation you need to succeed in an intensive program.

**The work you put in here is an investment in yourself.**

## Pre-Work Overview

### Time Commitment

Plan for **40-60 hours total**. This is not a weekend project.

Most people complete it in 2-4 weeks, working 10-20 hours per week. Some push through faster. Some need more time. The pace is up to you, but the quality is not negotiable.

### The Modules

| # | Module | Hours | What You'll Build |
|---|--------|-------|-------------------|
| 1 | [Terminal & Shell](01-terminal.md) | 8-10 | Command line proficiency |
| 2 | [VS Code Setup](02-vscode.md) | 4-6 | Your development environment |
| 3 | [Git & GitHub](03-git.md) | 8-10 | Version control and collaboration |
| 4 | [HTML & CSS](04-html-css.md) | 12-16 | Building and styling web pages |
| 5 | [JavaScript Programming](05-javascript.md) | 10-14 | Logic, DOM manipulation, interactivity |
| 6 | [Capstone: Your Portfolio](06-capstone.md) | 8-12 | Everything comes together |

### The Final Deliverable

Your capstone is a **personal portfolio website about you**. Not a generic project everyone builds the same way. Your portfolio. Your story. Your proof.

This portfolio will include specific features that demonstrate what you've learned. You'll deploy it to GitHub Pages. And you'll walk us through every line of code in your interview.

**One URL. Everything you've learned. All in one place.**

## Start Your Journey

Ready to begin? Start with [Module 1: Terminal & Shell](01-terminal.md).

Work through each module in order. Take your time, do the exercises, and don't move on until you're confident with the material.

---

## Submission

When your portfolio is complete and deployed complete your application form and apply.

---

## What's Next

### After You Submit

Your portfolio will be reviewed by the VWC team. If your submission meets our standards, you'll be scheduled for a technical interview.

### The Interview

The interview is a conversation about your work—not a test designed to trip you up.

- You'll share your screen and walk us through your portfolio
- We'll ask you to explain specific functions and design decisions
- We may ask you to make a small modification to demonstrate understanding
- We want to see your thought process and ensure you're set up for success

### Possible Outcomes

| Outcome | What It Means |
|---------|---------------|
| **✅ Approved** | Welcome to the Hashflag Stack. We're excited to have you. |
| **🔄 Revisions Needed** | You're close. We'll provide specific feedback on what to address. |
| **📚 More Preparation Recommended** | Additional foundation work would help you succeed. We'll suggest resources and welcome you to reapply. |

### Preparing for Day 1

If you're approved:

- [ ] Review your pre-work. Everything in the main curriculum builds on this.
- [ ] Rest. The program is intense.
- [ ] Set up your schedule. 20-24 hours per week for 17 weeks.
- [ ] Tell your family. They need to know you'll be busy.
- [ ] Show up ready to work.

## Looking Ahead

Completing this pre-work represents a significant accomplishment. You've put in 40-60 hours of focused learning—more preparation than many programs require.

The Hashflag Stack will be challenging. The pace is faster, and the material goes deeper. But you've already demonstrated the discipline and capability to handle it.

**You've done the work. You're ready for what's next.**

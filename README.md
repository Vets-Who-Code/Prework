## [Prework](https://vetswhocode.io)

Welcome to the official Vets Who Code Prework.
Here you'll find mandatory tutorials that need to be completed to be considered for the program.
This can also be used as a great refresher for grads and newbies interested alike.
While, we don't expect you to be experts, but we do expect you to be **familiar**.
There is a lot of content to consume here, get used to the fire hose! üë®üèª‚Äçüöí

<h2 id="web-presence">Web Presence</h2>

You should have a professional presence on all of the below platforms, as well as a professional email account. A [personal brand](http://blog.thefirehoseproject.com/posts/personal-branding-software-developer/) is really important.

- [Twitter](https://twitter.com)
- [Codepen](https://codepen.io)
- [GitHub](https://github.com)
- [Dev.to](https://dev.to/)
- [LinkedIn Veteran](https://linkedinforgood.linkedin.com/programs/veterans/premiumform)

Another important aspect of communicating your brand on the Internet as a developer is being able to use Markdown formatting. Markdown is a way to write plain text documents that get formatted into html for display on the web. This guide you're currently reading is written in Markdown. Markdown is extremely popular in 2018 and as part of the prework, you're going to take some time to understand it. <br />[Markdown Tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)

<h2 id="command-line">Know Your Tool</h2>

Being able to code well requires you to be able to use your machine well. We're going to start with setting up your machine and then move into learning a few tools that are staples to web development. If you're on Windows your setup instructions are [here](https://github.com/Vets-Who-Code/prework/blob/master/Windows-Tooling.md), MacOS users look [here](https://github.com/Vets-Who-Code/prework/blob/master/MacOS-Tooling.md).

### Code Editor

VS Code is our primary text editor and is **MANDATORY**. Download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and play around with it to become familiar since you will spend many hours in this environment!

### Command Line Interface

Next up, learning what the heck the command line is. Dig in! You wont be the same after you learn how command the terminal. Work through this tutorial [here](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/intro_to_command_line/)! Here's a [great tool](https://explainshell.com/) to decode some of those spell like chunks of texts you've been blindly copy pasting into your terminal. üîÆ

### Git

Git is used to track who changed what on files, as well as many other things. It's going to be one of your top tools, so bookmark the [documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc). Next, if you're on Mac run `brew install git`, else if you're on Windows run `choco install git.install`. Now, work through [this](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) hands on tutorial, don't worry it's really quick. Now take a look at [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow), it may seem a little advanced, but this is how we use git within Vets Who Code. The reason is because that's how the real world works with Git.


[Github Tutorial](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron#what-to-install) (don't worry too much about reading all of these. Wet your pallette and bookmark for later)

### Browser

[Download Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_ca/chrome/) (This is our browser we prefer for our dev environment.)


<h2 id="html">HTML & CSS</h2>

Below is a tutorial covering what web development is, what web development is comprised of, as well as how it all comes together to create
web applications. The tutorial mentions installing Atom, don't worry about that. You're going to use VScode instead. üòâ

[HTML & CSS Tutorial (READ)](https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/)

Getting a good grasp of how to layout websites is VERY important. The course below is going to get you moving on just that with some cool new additions to CSS.

<h2 id="javascript">JavaScript</h2>

JavScript is where you go from being an artist to being a wizard in web development. A deep knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals will make you a highly employable developer. Complete Javascript Info to get a good beginner grasp of JS.

JavaScript is derived from ECMAScript. This is important since new versions come out having major impact on JavaScript. Read through this resource to understand the newest version of ECMAScript:

<h2 id="capstone">Capstone</h2>

Build a website telling about you and include your favorite things and then push it to GitHub. Bonus points if you use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or [surge.sh](https://surge.sh/) to host your site.

**NOTICE: DO NOT USE A TEMPLATE OR THEME IF USING THIS PREWORK TO APPLY FOR VETSWHOCODE. USE ONLY YOUR OWN HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT.**
